            <p>These photos capture my trip to <strong>Las Vegas</strong> in <strong>June 2025</strong>, a city known for its bright lights, nonstop energy, and over-the-top attractions. Walking along the <strong>Las Vegas Strip</strong> felt surreal, with each hotel offering its own theme and atmosphere, especially at night when the city truly comes alive.</p>

            <p>One of the biggest highlights of the trip was seeing <strong>Coldplay live in concert</strong>, an unforgettable experience that combined incredible music, lights, and an amazing crowd. The concert atmosphere was electric and easily one of my favorite live performances I’ve ever attended.</p>

            <p>Beyond the city, I also had the chance to visit the <strong>Grand Canyon</strong>, which was a completely different but equally memorable experience. Seeing its massive scale and natural beauty in person was breathtaking and felt like the perfect contrast to the fast-paced energy of Vegas. The mix of live music, iconic city sights, and one of the world’s most stunning natural landmarks made this trip truly unforgettable.</p>

                <p>These photos follow my visits to <strong>Montreal</strong> and <strong>Quebec City</strong>, two beautiful and historic cities in Canada. I first explored them in <strong>2015</strong> and returned in <strong>2021</strong>, experiencing their charm twice. </p>

                <p>Quebec City’s <strong>Fairmont Le Château Frontenac</strong> stands as an iconic landmark, while <strong>Montmorency Falls</strong> showcases nature’s power. Strolling through the picturesque downtown of Quebec City, witnessing streets such as <strong>Umbrella Alley</strong>, added to the city’s enchanting European feel. </p>
                    
                <p>Montreal, a lively city infused with French influences, impressed me with its blend of architecture and nature. The <strong>St. James United Church</strong> and the beautiful <strong>Botanical Gardens</strong> provided a mix of culture and relaxation. At the <strong>Montreal Olympic Stadium Biodome</strong>, I even encountered a varity of animal species, such as penguins. </p>
                    
                <p>Both visits allowed me to appreciate the rich history, breathtaking scenery, and vibrant atmosphere of these cities, making them some of my favorite travel experiences. </p>

                <p>These photos capture my travels across <strong>Florida</strong>, a state I’ve explored throughout the years. I’ve visited <strong>Miami</strong> (<strong>2021</strong>, <strong>2015</strong>, <strong>2011</strong>), <strong>Naples</strong> (<strong>2021</strong>), <strong>Key West</strong> (<strong>2021</strong>), and <strong>Orlando</strong> (<strong>2015</strong>, <strong>2014</strong>, <strong>2013</strong>, <strong>2011</strong>), each trip bringing its own unforgettable experiences.</p>

                <p><strong>Miami</strong> holds a special place in my heart, not just for its stunning beaches and vibrant nightlife but also because most of my Cuban family lives there. The city is a cultural hub, shaped by generations of Cuban immigrants who have brought their traditions, food, and music. Walking through <strong>Little Havana</strong>, sipping coffee, or hearing the lively rhythms of salsa and reggaeton, I always feel connected to my roots.</p>

                <p><strong>Orlando</strong> was a big part of my childhood, with multiple visits to <strong>Disneyworld</strong> and <strong>Universal Studios</strong>, where I made incredible memories with my cousins—posing with <strong>Pluto</strong>, exploring <strong>Cars Land</strong>, and taking in the magical atmosphere.</p>

                <p>In <strong>Key West</strong> (<strong>2021</strong>), I stood at the iconic <strong>Southernmost Point</strong>, just 90 miles from <strong>Cuba</strong>— a powerful reminder of my heritage. <strong>Naples</strong> (<strong>2021</strong>), on the other hand, was all about relaxation, ending my day with a breathtaking sunset at the <strong>pier</strong>.</p>

                <p>From family reunions in <strong>Miami</strong> to thrilling theme park adventures in <strong>Orlando</strong>, my <strong>Florida</strong> trips have always been filled with nostalgia, culture, and fun.</p>
