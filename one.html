            <p>These photos follow my visits to <strong>Montreal</strong> and <strong>Quebec City</strong>, two beautiful and historic cities in Canada. I first explored them in <strong>2015</strong> and returned in <strong>2021</strong>, experiencing their charm twice. </p>

            <p>Quebec City’s <strong>Fairmont Le Château Frontenac</strong> stands as an iconic landmark, while <strong>Montmorency Falls</strong> showcases nature’s power. Strolling through the picturesque downtown of Quebec City, witnessing streets such as <strong>Umbrella Alley</strong>, added to the city’s enchanting European feel. </p>
                
            <p>Montreal, a lively city infused with French influences, impressed me with its blend of architecture and nature. The <strong>St. James United Church</strong> and the beautiful <strong>Botanical Gardens</strong> provided a mix of culture and relaxation. At the <strong>Montreal Olympic Stadium Biodome</strong>, I even encountered a varity of animal species, such as penguins. </p>
                
            <p>Both visits allowed me to appreciate the rich history, breathtaking scenery, and vibrant atmosphere of these cities, making them some of my favorite travel experiences. </p>

            <p>These photos capture my travels across <strong>Florida</strong>, a state I’ve explored throughout the years. I’ve visited <strong>Miami</strong> (<strong>2021</strong>, <strong>2015</strong>, <strong>2011</strong>), <strong>Naples</strong> (<strong>2021</strong>), <strong>Key West</strong> (<strong>2021</strong>), and <strong>Orlando</strong> (<strong>2015</strong>, <strong>2014</strong>, <strong>2013</strong>, <strong>2011</strong>), each trip bringing its own unforgettable experiences.</p>

            <p><strong>Miami</strong> holds a special place in my heart, not just for its stunning beaches and vibrant nightlife but also because most of my Cuban family lives there. The city is a cultural hub, shaped by generations of Cuban immigrants who have brought their traditions, food, and music. Walking through <strong>Little Havana</strong>, sipping coffee, or hearing the lively rhythms of salsa and reggaeton, I always feel connected to my roots.</p>

            <p><strong>Orlando</strong> was a big part of my childhood, with multiple visits to <strong>Disneyworld</strong> and <strong>Universal Studios</strong>, where I made incredible memories with my cousins—posing with <strong>Pluto</strong>, exploring <strong>Cars Land</strong>, and taking in the magical atmosphere.</p>

            <p>In <strong>Key West</strong> (<strong>2021</strong>), I stood at the iconic <strong>Southernmost Point</strong>, just 90 miles from <strong>Cuba</strong>— a powerful reminder of my heritage. <strong>Naples</strong> (<strong>2021</strong>), on the other hand, was all about relaxation, ending my day with a breathtaking sunset at the <strong>pier</strong>.</p>

            <p>From family reunions in <strong>Miami</strong> to thrilling theme park adventures in <strong>Orlando</strong>, my <strong>Florida</strong> trips have always been filled with nostalgia, culture, and fun.</p>

            <p>These photos capture the highlights of my trips to <strong>Cancún</strong> (<strong>2018</strong>, <strong>2016</strong>) and <strong>Riviera Maya</strong> (<strong>2013</strong>, <strong>2012</strong>)—destinations that offer the perfect mix of stunning beaches, <strong>Mayan history</strong>, and thrilling adventures. Whether relaxing on the soft sands of <strong>Cancún</strong>’s world famous coastline or exploring adrenaline pumping <strong>eco parks</strong>, every trip was filled with unforgettable experiences.</p>
            <p>The beaches of <strong>Cancún</strong> and <strong>Riviera Maya</strong> are truly spectacular, with crystal clear turquoise waters, powdery white sand, and breathtaking sunsets. Some of my best memories were spent relaxing by the shore, swimming in the warm <strong>Caribbean Sea</strong>, and enjoying beachfront resorts with endless ocean views. The water was perfect for <strong>snorkeling</strong>, where I saw colorful fish and coral reefs. <strong>Cancún</strong>’s vibrant <strong>hotel zone</strong> was ideal for lively beach days, while <strong>Riviera Maya</strong> had more secluded spots, offering a peaceful escape into nature.</p>
            <p>My most favorite experiences came from the thrilling and action packed adventure parks and excursions. Here are some of my favourites that I have visited:</p>
            <div style="text-align: left;">
                <p style="color: #0077b6"><a href="https://www.xelha.com/en/"><strong>Xel-Há: The Ultimate Natural Water Park</strong></a></p>
                <p>At <strong>Xel-Há</strong>, I experienced a natural aquatic paradise where I snorkeled alongside tropical fish in <strong>cenotes</strong> and swam in a massive open sea inlet. Floating down the <strong>lazy river</strong> in an inner tube, surrounded by lush jungle, was one of the most relaxing experiences. For adventure, I tried <strong>cliff jumping</strong>, <strong>zip lines</strong> that land in the water, and even <strong>biking</strong> through jungle trails.</p>
                <p style="color: #0077b6"><a href="https://www.xensespark.com/en/"><strong>Xenses: A Mind Bending Adventure</strong></a></p>
                <p>Visiting <strong>Xenses</strong> was unlike anything I’d ever done—it’s a <strong>sensory illusion park</strong> that plays with perception. I walked through a town where <strong>gravity was reversed</strong>, floated effortlessly in a <strong>salt river</strong>, and entered a <strong>pitch dark cave</strong> that heightened my other senses. The <strong>Xensatorium</strong> simulated different ecosystems using only sound and touch, making it a surreal experience.</p>
                <p style="color: #0077b6"><a href="https://www.xcaret.com/en/parks-and-tours/xplor-admission/?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADwu_nYs7J3lT79Gu_hEyDlzS3yxi&gclid=CjwKCAjwwLO_BhB2EiwAx2e-33u3pI1-U5XwKRmPd7__nz1J7b7UOa2M_C733ztb35YRbTQynQJWExoClmEQAvD_BwE"><strong>Xplor: The Ultimate Adventure Park</strong></a></p>
                <p><strong>Xplor</strong> was pure adrenaline, featuring the longest <strong>zip lines</strong> in <strong>Riviera Maya</strong>, which soared above the jungle with breathtaking views. I also drove an <strong>amphibious vehicle</strong> through caves and water filled trails, swam in <strong>underground rivers</strong> illuminated by <strong>stalactites</strong>, and rafted through <strong>subterranean caves</strong>. The park’s <strong>torch lit underground rivers</strong> made it feel like an Indiana Jones adventure.</p>
                <p style="color: #0077b6"><a href="https://www.selvatica.com.mx"><strong>Selvatica: The Jungle Adventure</strong></a></p>
                <p>At <strong>Selvatica</strong>, I experienced one of the most thrilling <strong>zip-lining circuits</strong> in <strong>Mexico</strong>, flying through the <strong>jungle canopy</strong>. After zip-lining, I took an <strong>ATV ride</strong> through muddy jungle trails and ended the adventure by jumping into a <strong>cenote</strong>, a deep natural sinkhole filled with refreshing blue water.</p>
                <p>Between the <strong>beaches</strong>, <strong>adventure parks</strong>, and <strong>cultural experiences</strong>, my trips to <strong>Cancún</strong> and <strong>Riviera Maya</strong> had the perfect mix of relaxation and excitement. Whether I was floating in the sea, zip-lining over the jungle, or exploring underground rivers, <strong>Mexico</strong> always offered something new and unforgettable.</p>
