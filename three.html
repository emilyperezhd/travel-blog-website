                <p>In <strong>2019</strong>, I went to <strong>Costa Rica</strong>, and it was completely different from any other trip I’ve taken. We stayed in <strong>La Fortuna</strong>, a town surrounded by <strong>rainforest</strong>, <strong>volcanoes</strong>, and <strong>rivers</strong>—and spent the entire time in the <strong>jungle</strong>.</p>
                <p>Instead of <strong>beaches</strong> or <strong>city tours</strong>, every day was packed with <strong>outdoor adventure</strong>. We went on long <strong>hikes</strong> through the rainforest, crossed <strong>suspension bridges</strong>, and saw wildlife like <strong>sloths</strong>, <strong>snakes</strong>, and <strong>colorful birds</strong>. We visited <strong>hot springs</strong> heated by <strong>Arenal Volcano</strong>, went <strong>ziplining</strong> high above the trees, and even tried <strong>bungee jumping</strong>.</p>
                <p>One of the highlights was <strong>hiking</strong> to bright blue <strong>rivers</strong> and <strong>climbing up waterfalls</strong>—including the famous <strong>Rio Celeste</strong>, which looks unreal in person. It was the most <strong>active trip</strong> I’ve ever done, and every day felt like a new <strong>challenge</strong> or <strong>discovery</strong>.</p>

                <p>These photos represent <strong>Cuba</strong>, a place that is deeply connected to my identity and family history. My entire background is <strong>Cuban</strong>—all of my grandparents and most of my cousins still live there. My parents immigrated to <strong>Canada</strong> in <strong>2003</strong>, but I grew up visiting <strong>Cuba</strong> almost every year until <strong>2015</strong>, when we started bringing my family from <strong>Cuba</strong> to visit us in <strong>Canada</strong> instead.</p>
                <p>Every visit to <strong>Cuba</strong> was more than just a trip—it was about <strong>family reunions</strong>, reconnecting with my roots, and immersing myself in the <strong>Cuban way of life</strong>. From the warmth of my relatives to the vibrant energy of <strong>Havana’s streets</strong>, every moment felt like home. The country’s rich <strong>culture</strong>, lively <strong>music</strong>, and strong sense of <strong>community</strong> have shaped my identity.</p>
                <p><strong>Cuba</strong> is home to some of the most beautiful <strong>beaches</strong> in the world, with crystal clear turquoise waters and soft white sand. One of my favorite memories was <strong>paddleboarding</strong> with family, enjoying the peaceful <strong>ocean</strong> while surrounded by breathtaking views. The <strong>beach</strong> was always a place for <strong>relaxation</strong>, <strong>fun</strong>, and making memories with my loved ones.</p>
                <p>Even though I no longer visit <strong>Cuba</strong> as often, it remains a huge part of who I am. My <strong>family</strong>, <strong>traditions</strong>, and <strong>childhood memories</strong> are all deeply rooted there. Whether it was <strong>playing on the beach</strong>, <strong>running through Havana’s plazas</strong>, or <strong>celebrating milestones</strong> with loved ones, <strong>Cuba</strong> will always be a place that feels like home to me.</p>

                <p>One of the highlights was encountering <strong>wild donkeys</strong>, a unique part of <strong>Aruba’s landscape</strong>. The island’s clear waters made it ideal for <strong>snorkeling</strong>, where I swam among <strong>colorful fish</strong> and vibrant <strong>marine life</strong>. For a more thrilling experience, I went <strong>jet skiing</strong>, racing along the coastline, and <strong>parasailing</strong>, enjoying breathtaking views of the island from above.</p>
                <p><strong>Aruba’s natural beauty</strong> and variety of <strong>activities</strong> made it an unforgettable destination.

                <p>I’ve been to the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong> (specifically <strong>Punta Cana</strong>) twice — once in <strong>2010</strong>, and again in <strong>2017</strong>. Both trips were really different, but each one had its highlights.</p>
                <p>In <strong>2010</strong>, I went with my family and did some fun, touristy stuff. I got my <strong>hair braided</strong>, which felt like a must do at the time. We also visited a spot where you could <strong>interact with animals</strong>—I got to <strong>hold a monkey</strong> and even a <strong>toucan</strong>. That trip was more about <strong>exploring</strong> and trying out new things with my family.</p>
                <p>The photos here are from <strong>2017</strong>, which was more <strong>beach </strong> and <strong>activity focused</strong>. I went <strong>helmet diving</strong> for the first time, which was a cool experience walking along the <strong>ocean floor</strong> surrounded by <strong>fish</strong>. We also went <strong>tubing</strong> behind a boat, hung out on the <strong>beach</strong>, and just enjoyed the <strong>sun</strong>. It was a fun, relaxed trip with lots of time in and around the <strong>water</strong>.</p>
                <p>Both trips were super memorable in their own way. The first one was more about <strong>discovery</strong>, and the second was more about <strong>fun</strong> and <strong>soaking it all in</strong>.</p>
