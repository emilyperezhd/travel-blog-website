# Travel Blog Website

Live Site: https://travel-blog-website-emily-perez.vercel.app/home.html

## Overview
This project is a personal travel blog website showcasing destinations I have visited across North America, Central America, and Europe. The site highlights when each destination was visited, key experiences, travel photos, and curated travel tips for both beach vacations and tourist-focused trips.

The website was developed as part of a Web Development course project with strict constraints to use only HTML and CSS. The project received a final grade of 100%.

- Visit timelines with key highlights
- Integrated travel photography
- Travel tips for beach vacations and tourist-heavy travel

No JavaScript, frameworks, or external libraries were used, in accordance with course requirements.

## Project Constraints

- Emphasis on structure, layout, and styling fundamentals  

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:
